    <p class="labelborder">Choosing the Right Prop for Your Engine</p>
        
                    <p>In order to maximize your boat’s performance and fuel efficiency, the right prop has to be matched with your particular boat’s engine. 
                    Determining the correct size and style of boat prop will keep your engine operating within its recommended RPM range. 
                    This not only allows optimal horsepower to be applied to the water, but also makes for improved handling.</p>
                    <p>The kind of prop your engine needs depends largely on how you’re using your boat. 
                    Whether fishing, cruising, or water skiing, different applications place different loads on your engine. 
                    Regardless of application, the key is to keep your engine within its factory-recommended wide-open throttle (WOT) RPM ratings, which are easily found in your owner’s manual. 
                    Selecting a prop with the right pitch, diameter, rake, surface area, and contour for your engine will keep you within your RPM range.</p>
                    <p>For an informative read about how the correct propeller can change your boat’s performance, take a look at <a href="http://www.popularmechanics.com/adventure/outdoors/a5650/1276976/" target="_blank">this Popular Mechanics’ article</a> that compares six different props using the same boat.</p>
                    <p>Already have an idea of what you’re looking for? Get started now by using our handy <a href="#PropSelector">Prop Selector Tool</a> to narrow your search results. 
                    Our Prop Selector will choose exactly what you need from our wide selection of boat props from quality brands like <a href="https://www.savvyboater.com/powertech-boat-propellers/" target="_blank">PowerTech</a>, <a href="https://www.savvyboater.com/solas-boat-propellers/" target="_blank">Solas</a>, and <a href="https://www.savvyboater.com/michigan-wheel-boat-propellers/" target="_blank">Michigan Wheel</a>.</p>

<p class="labelborder">Testing Your Propeller's Performance</p>

                    <p>Testing your propeller’s performance is simple, not to mention fun. 
                    When you have the right propeller for your boat, and it’s functioning properly, your boat’s engine should operate as expected. 
                    This means that your engine should run within the manufacturer’s designated RPM when running at Wide Open Throttle (WOT). 
                    If this doesn’t occur, you probably need a new prop for your boat.</p>
                    <h3>Step-By-Step:</h3>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Make sure your gas tank is full, but that the overall load in your boat is “normal.” 
                            Do not test with the maximum number of people on board, but make sure the load accurately mimics what you normally carry.</li>
                            <li>Run your boat for at least 5 minutes to ensure your engine is properly warmed up.</li>
                            <li>Find a wide open piece of water with little or no other boat traffic.</li>
                            <li>Give your engine full throttle and get it up to maximum speed.</li>
                            <li>When at maximum speed, note and record your RPM.</li>
                            <li>Take a run in the other direction, repeating steps three through five. 
                            Taking two measurements and averaging them ensures a more accurate reading by eliminating factors such as wind and current.</li>
                        </ol>

<a id="basics"></a>
<p class="labelborder">Pitch and Diameter Basics</p>

    <div class="propDiamPitch">
                    <h3>Diameter</h3>
                    <div>
                        <p>Prop diameter is the distance it takes a blade to rotate from a 3 o’clock position to a 9 o’clock position (a semi-circle). 
                        To determine your prop’s diameter, measure from the outside edge of one blade straight into the center of the prop shaft, then multiply that number by two. 
                        This is your diameter.</p>
                        <p>Changes in diameter can affect the way a boat carries itself. 
                        Usually, the lower the pitch (which we’ll talk about next), the greater the diameter.</p>
                        <p>A larger diameter is generally better for:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Pushing heavy loads</li>
                            <li>Maneuvering at low speeds</li>
                            <li>Getting excellent hole shot (thanks to expanded grip on the water)</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Smaller diameter propellers spin faster, making them a good choice for performance boats that need higher top-end speeds.</p>
                    </div>
                    <h3>How to Identify Your Diameter & Pitch</h3>
                 
                    <div>
                        <p>In most cases, the diameter and pitch will be stamped on the hub of your prop. 
                        Large or small, diameter is the first number listed. 
                        A prop noted as 14 x 17 x 3 means the prop has a diameter of 14", a pitch of 17", and has three blades. <a href="https://cdn3.bigcommerce.com/s-uprkx/product_images/uploaded_images/prop-diameter-pitch.jpg" target="_blank">Click to see image.</a></p>
                    </div>
                    <h3>Pitch</h3>
                        <p>Pitch controls your engine’s RPM (revolutions per minute) and is the final “gear ratio” adjustment on any given boat. 
                        It also affects the performance of a propeller more than any other aspect.</p>
                        <p>Specifically, pitch is "the distance a propeller would move in one full revolution if it were moving through a soft solid, like a screw through wood,” assuming there is no slippage. 
                        For example, a 21-pitch propeller would move forward 21 inches in one revolution.</p>
                        <p>Propeller slip (slippage) is the difference between actual and theoretical propeller travel. 
                        Slip happens with every propeller, though the amount shifts depending on overall design.</p>
                        <p><strong>High Pitch</strong> (lower RPM)</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Faster at top-end speeds</li>
                            <li>Typically used on larger boats</li>
                            <li>If pitch is too high for your engine, it will "lug" the engine, reducing both top speed and performance</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><strong>Low Pitch</strong> (higher RPM)</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Increases acceleration</li>
                            <li>Improves fuel efficiency</li>
                            <li>Increases pulling power</li>
                            <li>Typically used on smaller boats</li>
                            <li>If your pitch is too low, the engine will exceed its specified RPM at top-end speeds</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <p><a href="https://cdn3.bigcommerce.com/s-uprkx/product_images/uploaded_images/prop-pitch.jpg?t=1473362856" target="_blank">Click to see image.</a><br><br><strong>**Note: Sustained operation with a pitch that’s either too low or too high can cause damage to your engine.</strong></p>

 <p class="labelborder">3-Blade vs. 4-Blade Props</p>

<p>Three or four-blade props, how do you know which to choose for your boat? It’s all about compromise and goals.</p>
<p>Your best bet for choosing between a 3-blade or 4-blade prop is knowing what kind of performance you want from your boat—general, hole shot, top-end speed, fuel economy, high-end. Thanks to <a href="https://www.boattest.com/view-news/3276_which-is-better-4-blades-or-3-blades" target="_blank">this blade comparison article</a> on BoatTest.com (written by PowerTech’s own Marcus Clemens!), the reasons for 4-blade over 3-blade props are fairly clear. Four-blade props can help practical, all-around boat performance by enhancing:</p>
<ul>
                        <li>Low-speed planing</li>
                        <li>Fuel efficiency</li>
                        <li>Cruise efficiency</li>
                        <li>Big seas performance</li>
                        <li>Down-current performance</li>
                        <li>Ventilation/cavitation resistance</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>As described above, 4-blade props generally translate to a faster hole shot and reduced vibration, albeit with less steering torque. 
                    When a maximum top speed is the goal for your stern drive or outboard boat, 3-blade props are usually the best option. 
For a side-by-side comparison of 3-blade vs. 4-blade props, take a look at our chart below.</p>

                    <p>Regardless of the reasons to opt for a three or four-blade prop, doing on-water testing in repeatable conditions is the way to go. 
                    On-water testing is the best way to achieve the most accurate blade selection for your boat and its particular application. 
                    Plus, it’s another excuse to get out on the water!</p>

  <p class="labelborder">Pressed-in Hub vs. Interchangeable Hub</p>

<p><strong>The hub</strong> is the center of the boat propeller where the blades attach. The center of the hub will slide over the propeller shaft. In many cases this is the point where exhaust exits the engine.</p>
                    <p>The splines of the hub must exactly match those of the shaft. <a href="https://www.savvyboater.com/product_images/uploaded_images/prop-hub-splines.jpg" target="_blank">Click to see image</a></p>

                    <h3>Cup</h3>
                    <p>The propeller’s cup is the curved lip on the blade tip. Cupping a propeller will cause a decrease in RPMs, giving it high performance and minimizing cavitation under heavy loads.</p>
                    <h3>Rotation</h3>
                    <div>
                        <p>Propellers spin right (clockwise) or left (counterclockwise).</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Dual propellers</strong> have two blades that spin in opposite directions</li>
                            <li><strong>Right-hand rotation</strong> is standard</li>
                            <li><strong>Left-hand rotation</strong> is mainly used for one engine in a dual motor application to balance performance across the two engines</li>

                        </ul>
                   
                    <h3>Rake</h3>
                        <p>Rake is the angle of the tip of the blade’s tilt forward or backward in relation to the hub. The angle is measured on a line extending from the center of the hub through the center of one blade.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Aft (Negative)</strong> rake tilts away from the hub—this helps the bow of the boat get up and out of the water, which creates less drag and results in higher top-end speeds</li>
                            <li><strong>Forward (Positive)</strong> rake allows for a larger propeller which will give quicker hole shot for towing skiers</li>

                                <td><strong>Replace</strong> old, worn-out propellers. Running on a bent, chipped, or pock-marked prop will lead to cavitation as well as expensive damage to the engine and stern drive.</td>

                                <td><strong>Grease</strong> the moving parts of the propeller with a marine-quality waterproof product. Use the grease before fitting the boat prop and as part of your routine maintenance procedure.</td>

                    <h3>What is Cavitation?</h3>
                    
                        <p>Cavitation is any erosion, pock marks, or irregular edges on the surface of the propeller. 
                        When a pocket of air forms on the backside of a propeller blade, the impact of air bubbles on the actual blade causes cavitation. 
                        This usually happens when a propeller’s RPMs are too high for its design. </p>
                    
                    <h3>How to Avoid Cavitation</h3>
                   
                        <p>The best way to avoid cavitation is to choose the correct propeller pitch for your engine. 
                        You can also reduce the chances of prop cavitation by opting for stainless steel, or by going with blades that offer a cupped design.</p>
                        <p>Damage from soft material can also lead to cavitation—not to mention reduced fuel economy and a drop in overall efficiency. 
                        A stainless steel prop will hold up to silt and sand exposure, and thus cavitation, very well. </p>
                    
                    
                    <h3>Troubleshooting Boat Vibration</h3>
                  
                        <p>Vibration usually comes from one of four things: the propeller, the engine, the shaft, or the shaft supports. 
                        Though these other factors shouldn't be ignored, the number one culprit tends to be the propeller. 
                        Prop vibration can come from several root causes, including imbalance, a worn hub, insufficient tip clearance, or inadequate blade area.</p>
                        <p>Cavitation is another common cause of boat prop vibration. 
                        When a prop has insufficient blade area, the blades get overloaded. 
                        This causes cavitation, blade erosion and, ultimately, vibration.</p>
